# üì± Mobile Performance Prediction

## üîç Project Overview
This machine learning project aims to predict the **Total Benchmark Score** of smartphones based on their hardware specifications. The benchmark score is an important metric that reflects the performance of a device, which can be useful for comparisons, analytics, or filling in missing benchmark data.

We use a regression-based approach with `Linear Regression` as a baseline model. The project covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insights into the features impacting mobile performance.
